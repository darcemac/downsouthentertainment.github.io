Genre: Blues/Rock/Pop

Alistair McIlroy has always had a strong love affair with making music. From an early age playing piano to his passion for guitar today he has written songs about life, love, travel and change in his own, earnest, bluesy style.

After a five year global adventure with his surfboard and guitar Al returned home to Margaret River where he rapidly became renowned as a fantastic muso, brilliant mechanic, successful businessman and all round great bloke.
With influences as diverse as The Beatles, Dave Matthews, Manu Chau, Led Zeppelin and Harry Manx, travelling has been a great source of inspiration for his songs as his musical style absorbed the rich aural flavours of the continents where he spent much time such as Europe, South America and Africa.

Al Mac has performed at a variety of corporate events and weddings in the Margaret River region as well popular local venues like Caves House, Settlers Tavern, The Dunsborough Tavern, Bootleg Brewery and Altitude Bar.
The Summer of 2013 promises to be a fruitful one for Al with an album in the making and a plethora of bookings already locked in.
