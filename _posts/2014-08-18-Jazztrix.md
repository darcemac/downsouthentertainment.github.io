Jazztrix play a sizzling selection of tunes guaranteed to get any joint swingin’ with styles ranging between swing, bossa-nova, latin, soul-jazz, ballads and jazz-blues.
Jazztrix is fronted by the ebullient trumpet player and vocalist David ‘Jazztrix’ Rastrick and the ensemble can perform as a trio, quartet, quintet or even an eight piece ensemble at your request.

The band, which features some of the finest jazz musicians in the South West, is often joined by a special guest female vocalist to add that extra touch of magic. 

Formed in 2007 Jazztrix opened the Leeuwin Concerts from 2010 to 2014 as the opening act for musical legends such as; Carole King, James Morrison, Perth Symphony Orchestra, Boz Scaggs, Marina Prior, David Hobson, Michael MacDonald and Roxy Music and has played at events and venues including; Margaret River Wine Festival, Jazz Fremantle and Ellington Jazz Club. 

Jazztrix' sound is ideal as mood or feature music for weddings, private functions, corporate events, jazz concerts and festivals.  
Jazztrix are more than happy to learn a jazz piece specific to your event.
