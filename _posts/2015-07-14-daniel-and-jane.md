Thank you for the fantastic job you did for our wedding. From our first phone call we felt totally at ease and in such capable hands. Lee, having you take care of choosing music, the PA system and all of that jazz was such a treat and worked SO well.

The sets that The Goodtime Conductors played were absolutely fantastic and perfect for the feel of the night. Having our guests up on the dance floor loving the beats was so awesome to see and exactly what we wanted. 

We also loved and appreciated the little touches you added to the night, choosing "Super Styling" as we congaed down the sand dune, facilitating a dance off between two of our guests and generally just being cool dudes! 

Woo, we want to go back and do it all again! Really looking forward to recommending you to friends in the future. Thank you again
