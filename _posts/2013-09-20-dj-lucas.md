![DJ Lucas](/images/dj_lucas.jpg)

Raised by a father well renowned for his piano playing prowess, Lucas fell in love with music at an early age and has passionately immersed himself in it ever since. After travelling the world extensively and returning home to play drums in several well known Margaret River bands Lucas took his intrinsic understanding of rhythm and groove in a new direction as he began to DJ in the year 2000.

Since then DJ Lucas has become a well known entity in the South West social scene, playing a host of elite corporate events, openings, birthday celebrations, well known venues and weddings.

Lucas is a likeable guy which makes him a natural MC, a service he happily adds to his DJ duties when called for. He has excellent sound and lighting gear, a brilliant knowledge of the Margaret River region and venues, a vibrant, amicable nature and superb music catalogue.

A wedding specialist, DJ Lucas loves to find the right song for the right moment every time, keeping the dance floor rocking all night long.
