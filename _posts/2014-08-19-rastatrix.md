Genre: Reggae/Funk/Roots

Based in the heart of South West Australia, Rastratrix perform songs of love, revolution and freedom - playing reggae with a humorous and fun twist. 
Reggae icon Bob Marley once said that all styles of music can fit into reggae, and this West Australian group does just that, mixing funk, jazz, soul, world music and even hard rock into their sound, along with classic reggae based styles such as ska, dub, roots, drum'n'bass and dancehall.
