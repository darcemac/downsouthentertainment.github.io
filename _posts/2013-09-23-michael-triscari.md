Genre: Folk/Surf/Blues

Growing up in a South West coastal town has helped mould a unique style for this talented young troubadour who tours about with his silky smooth vocals, guitar and stomp box.

It's music he describes as "folk surf blues with a cruisy, oceanic vibe" and influences such as Woodie Guthrie, Bob Dylan and Peter Green echo through his relaxed yet passion filled performances.

Triscari loves surfing, skating, art, motorbikes and people enjoying the music he makes; "I just want people to feel my music...I like to connect with real people who get something out of my songs".
