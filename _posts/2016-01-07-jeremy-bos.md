Jeremy Bos is truly a DJ for all occasions. Over 10 years of experience has seen him entertaining crowds of all ages at all kinds of venues across Perth and the South West. Jeremy has played at over 100 weddings and held residencies at numerous bars and function centres. With a strong focus on tailoring playlists to suit each individual client and delivering the right music for any time slot he is able to sculpt an ideal atmosphere through the power of music. In this time heâ€™s played at everything from back yards to boats, weddings, festivals, theatres, pubs and nightclubs. His ability to read crowds and adapt to any situation is unmatched by most DJs.

His approach to DJing is to draw on a wide variety of sounds with a solid foundation of deep, tech-tinged house and funky, soulful, down tempo broken beats. He can also be heard filling in the gaps at parties and warming dancefloors with laid back lounge music, vintage blues, rock and hip hop.
