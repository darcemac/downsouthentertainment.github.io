Genre: Jazz/Funk/Heavy Elevator

This very unique duo describe their sound as “heavy elevator music”, it’s kind of background, but rocking at the same time. And if you ever got caught in an elevator then this soulful, audio travelling, candy to the ears would be the sort of music you’d want to be stuck with!

Blending an insane, custom made 8 string hybrid bass/electric guitar, dynamic effect pedals, state of the art electric drums, superb musicianship and masterful use of looping devices, Dave and Pat are pushing sonic boundaries and proving to be a most avant garde act in the South West musical landscape.

But they're not playing some kind of far out, self indulgent experimental jazz. Far from it.
These chilled out characters love locking in funky, smooth and rock solid grooves mixed with sublime melodies. It’s fantastic to witness such gifted musicians losing themselves in the music and simultaneously bringing their audience along for the ride.

If you’re looking for something different, unobtrusive and incredibly enjoyable Axolotl come highly recommended by Down South Entertainment.
