Genre: Junk Rock/Jazz/Funk

mUnk are a talented trio made up of three seasoned local musicians (keys, bass, drums) each as unique and eccentric as the next.

They brand their original sound as "jUnk" - a foot stomping blend of Jazz and Funk which slips seamlessly from corporate dinners to dance floors to weddings and all the way back again.

The three boast an impressive repertoire of radio-ready songs as diverse as their wicked senses of humour, which they weave together with fresh takes on old favourites and a generous dose of eclectic banter.

A band for the old, young and young at heart, mUnk are odd crowd favourites, steadily gaining momentum in the Western Australian music scene.
