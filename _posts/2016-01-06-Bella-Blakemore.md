***Bella Blakemore*** has been charming the South West for several years now with her evocative, powerful vocal style and cheerful, accommodating nature.
Bella plays a well-chosen mix of cover songs along with a host of original tunes, which make up a repertoire proven to be a crowd-pleaser; captivating or subtle depending on your vision for the performance. 

Of late Bella has been incorporating loop and harmony pedals into her solo set, and on occasion playing with a percussionist to enhance her sound.
A consummate professional, Bella plays venues, weddings and private parties and tailors each show perfectly to highlight her impressive talent, endearing personality and years of experience.
