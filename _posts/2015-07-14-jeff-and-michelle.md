We were absolutely thrilled with the Moonlight Era and Lee's coordination of all the music for our wedding. He worked hard to understand what we did (and didn't) want.

Even though we hadn't met Lee, we totally trusted his guidance and it all came together so beautifully. Thanks Lee for your responsive and thoughtful approach, we wouldn't hesitate to recommend others make use of this fantastic local company.
