![Doxettes Band](/images/doxettes.jpg)

‘The Doxettes’ are a three or four piece Margaret River musical experience.  Originally an offshoot of Jazz Combo “Doxy” the Doxettes have made their mark on the music scene.   

Playing a mix of old school jazz and blues with a blend of folk, rock and pop their sound is sweet and understated – perfect for occasions where the music needs to add, but not overpower the occasion.  

The combination of vocals, ukulele, bass and percussion brings a new life to some older musical styles.  ‘The Doxettes’ are Emjay Kim, Louise Marsh, Rod Whittle and Gary Larkin.
