Following our most successful festival ever, on behalf of the committee I would like to congratulate you on your amazing line up of musicians, plus your suggestions and assistance in organising new programmes/poster design and a professional promotional video.

We have had so many comments on your music from the public and residents and the town is still talking about the festival weeks later! Once again, thank you on behalf of Augusta River Festival Inc, we look forward to working with you next year. Congratulations!

Thanks a billion Lee, I can’t wait to work with you again! It’s been such a ball, hopefully it’s sooner rather than later!
