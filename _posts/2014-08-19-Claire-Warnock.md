Claire Warnock has, until recently, been one of the South-West's best kept secrets. Coupling a commanding, saucy vocal style with solid, rhythm-driven guitar work, Claire has created her own unique blend of sultry, soul blues.

Through her hard work running and performing at Open Mic Nights held at Settler's Tavern (the most prestigious live venue in the region) Claire has not only become a very familiar face within the local music scene, but honed her stage skills to an impeccably confident performance.

Claire is completely at home perofrming solo, however may also be booked with a backing band of distinguishable gentlemen from the Margaret River muisc scene. The band have been playing together since mid 2013 and thoroughly enjoy performing and writing new material as a group. 

"My aim is to play happy, toe tappin' tunes that bring joy to people.  I am loving the local music vibe right now and it is so great to be involved." 

Claire states her vocal influences as; Aretha Franklin, Lucinda Williams and Etta James.
