![Rory Faithfield](/images/rory-faithfield.jpg)

Rory Faithfield, though born in Australia, has thus far spent the majority of his musical career based in Dublin, Ireland. 2013 has brought him back to his roots in Western Australia, and we couldn't be more excited about it.

Faithfield's original influence as a teenager was the post-punk band scene of Sydney; sifting through ideas, lyrics and genres, looking for something that felt more real. This search inevitably lead him to London, where he soon found his voice as a solo artist after 'paying his musical dues' performing the demanding pub circuits of both Ireland and Germany.

1998 saw the release of his debut album, with follow up releases in 2002, 2007 and 2009. These albums have since earned him comparisons to legends such as Paul Kelly and secured Rory spots at festivals in Nannup, Port Fairy, Yungaburra, Maldon, Tarerer & Lake Bolac. "Faithfield inhabits the same rich musical world as Christy Moore, Luka Bloom and Glen Hansard. His songs are wistful, romantic, deeply felt, beautifully crafted and sung with a voice that pours sincerity and emotion over every line and note.‚Äù - Bruce Elder

Performing solo with an acoustic guitar, harmonicas and a loop station, together with a bag of stories and some uplifting audience interactivity, Rory is embracing his new 'local artist' status and "looking forward to having some fun bringing it all back home."
