Led by talented Al Mac on guitar and vocals and backed by three of Margaret River’s busiest and most experienced musicians, The Moonlight Era is a group of friends coming together to share their love of music and making bodies move with happiness!

Made up of band members better known for their various successful South West original music projects, The Moonlight Era gives these guys an opportunity to let their hair down as they pay tribute to a wide range of amazing songs from then and now.

From classics by The Beatles, Johnny Cash, Creedence Clearwater Revival and The Rolling Stones through to awesome favourites by Jack Johnson, Ben Harper and Black Keys, dance floor winners by Jamorique, Cake and Pharrell Williams and modern rippers by The Rubens, MGMT and Flight Facilities, the band have a blast belting out everything they play with gusto!

With an extensive repertoire and confident, fun loving stage presence The Moonlight Era have fast become the most highly sought after cover act in the South West.

The guys aren’t taking themselves too seriously but they sure are enjoying the ride!
