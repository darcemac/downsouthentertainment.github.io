Genre: Indie/Pop/Folk

The unassumingly cute and exceptionally gifted Juerlaine Prideaux (JJ to her friends) is stamping her unique mark all over the South West, one gig after another.

This young and talented artist is discreetly building up a profile as one of the premier singer-songwriters of the region, delivering sweet, relaxed performances featuring well chosen covers and her own incredible originals.

Juerlaine’s lyrics are intellectual and thought provoking and belie her age in their wisdom; while her performance execution again leads one to believe she has been living and playing her music for many more years than she in fact has.

Juerlaine is expected to release her debut EP in 2014, with an eagerly anticipated single “Greed”, due later this year.
