![DJ Chooda](/images/dj-chooda.jpg)

Fun loving DJ Chooda developed his skills playing clubs, parties and events in the amazing Cape Town dance scene.

Equipped with a fantastic selection of old school vinyl (passed on to him by his father - who was rockin' parties back in the 70's) and expansive digital archives, Chooda can provide sets varying from fun (non-cheesy) hits that everyone will know, modern/indie/JJJ flavours, as well as high-energy dance mixes encompassing funk, big beat, house, breaks and more.

A naturally charismatic character, Chooda adapts seamlessly to any given situation and has an enviable knack for making people smile...and dance!
