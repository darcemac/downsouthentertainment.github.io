Genre: Funk/World/Reggae

Infusing a dynamic mix of genres from groovy funk to reggae, with charismatic live performances, The Feeva have created an original vibe that draws together and unifies audiences through their catchy tunes.

“There’s great energy, crowd respect and affection for the material with this band…The collective energy on stage was massive...as per usual, a bombastic party.” – Rip-In Magazine.

The Feeva has played along side such acts as The Violent Femmes, Salmonella Dub, Afro Cuban All Stars, Gomez, The Cat Empire, The Living End and Gyroscope. The band played at three of South Africa’s largest music festivals in 2006, including The Billabong Pro in Jeffreys Bay and they also performed at the 2007 Big Day Out in Perth, The 2007 O’Neil Margaret River Masters and the 2007 Rip Curl Pro at Bells Beach (with Occy!).
