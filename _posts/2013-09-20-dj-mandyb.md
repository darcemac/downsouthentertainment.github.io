Mandy has been DJing for over 10 years, getting her first opportunities at popular Perth night spots like Geisha, Ambar, The Queens, The Funk Club and The Leftbank to name just a few. Since moving down South many years ago, DJ Mandy B has been rocking crew at great venues such as The Cape Wine Bar and Malt Market/Pourhouse in Dunsborough plus Morries Bar and Settlers Tavern in Margaret River. She has also always made regular, well received appearances within the South West house party scene.

A few years ago Mandy got roped into DJing at a friend's wedding and although initially reluctant she found that she actually thoroughly enjoyed herself...as did her audience! Since then she has perfected the craft of wedding DJing and confidently adds this to an already impressive repertoire.

Mandy Bubb's fun loving and personable nature mixed with her obvious love of music and all-round crowd pleasing abilities make her a favourite choice for venues, parties, weddings and functions alike.
