We decided to get married at a private residence near Yallingup, on New Years Eve 2012-13. We contacted "Down South Entertainment" to help us book music, which was a very important element to us and needed to be perfect.

Lee was awesome from the start; super friendly and approachable, with expansive knowledge of everything entertainment in the region. We explained what we were looking for and Lee helped us find a band, DJ, sound and lighting equipment to suit. The night was amazing and we were stoked!

Since then, the music and entertainment is the part of the wedding that weâ€™ve had the most comments about. We found DSE very professional and personal. 10/10, we would definitely recommend.
